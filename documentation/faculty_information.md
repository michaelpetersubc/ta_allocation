# Instruction for Faculty

At some point you should receive an email with at least one tracking url.  This gives you access to forms that allow you two adjust your preferences over 
potential teaching assistants for your courses this term.

The forms allow you to do two things: select a subset of all assignments that you are particularly interested in; and rank the assignments that you have selected.

One thing that will help you understand how your assignment is determined is that the algorithm takes place in two stages.  The first is a Phd student only matching.  All courses are available to them in this stage, including all the courses that do not require phd track assignments.  If there are more phd students to be assigned than there are phd track courses that require students, the phd students will be allocated to the masters track courses until all of them are given assignments, or all the assignments have been filled.

In the second stage masters students are allocated to the courses that remain.

## Option 1 - Ignore the form and don't bother

That is fine except that you'll end up with a randomly selected ta.  If you have a ta assignment that requires a phd student, then you will end up with a phd student.  He or she will be selected from the set of students who have not been 'requested' by other instructors.  If you are teaching a course that only requires a masters level ta, then again you will get a randomly chosen ta who may be from either the ta stream or the phd stream, depending on demand.

## Option 2 - choose a subset of ta's to single out for your course.

The forms you get when you follow the tracking url will first allow you to choose a subset of all the tas that you are particularly interested in.  If you have a course that requires a phd track ta, you don't have to select all the phd students, you get one automatically.  Any of the students that you add to your 'portfolio' are treated as if you strictly prefer any of them to students who you don't choose if that is all you do.

## Option 3 - choose a subset then rank them.

Once you have chosen a portfolio, you can go on to the ranking page, the link to which is in the preamble to the select form.  If you really want a student as your ta, just assign them a weight that is higher than 1.  If you want, you can strictly rank the students in your portfolio by assigning them each a different weight.  A higher weight is interpreted as a stronger preference in favor of the student.

If there is a student who you really don't want to have as your ta, add them to your portfolio and give them a weight of -1, and you won't get them.  It is possible that when you do this, you will not be allocated any ta - so be sure that you mean 'I would rather do the work myself than use this ta' whenever you give someone a weight of -1.
